## Jira Ticket APD-39 - Rendering Content Elements from Composer

- Calling `/content/v4/stories?website_url=${path}&website=ajc` to retrieve each content element type for a story, where `${path}` is the link to the story.
- Created different components for each element type.
- Added type name and content for better visualization.
